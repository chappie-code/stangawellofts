<p align="left">Karl von Gardony of Bright, Ontario, Canada 
                                        has been associated with the sport for 
                                        approximately 74 years. Before the age 
                                        of 10 years he had been bitten with the 
                                        pigeon bug and his commitment to the sport 
                                        has been second to none. Too numerous 
                                        to relate are his successes over the decades 
                                        which includes 26 Combine 1sts at 500 
                                        miles and there is no doubt that he occupies 
                                        an honoured place amongst the elite of 
                                        the North American pigeon racing fraternity. 
                                        In contrast with my own small stud Karl 
                                        von Gardony has approximately 85 birds 
                                        to race with on a weekly basis and as 
                                        there are two weekend races organized 
                                        from these he will choose about two score 
                                        to compete in each race. His selection 
                                        apparently is based upon his loft book 
                                        other than handling. As a result of this 
                                        method on occasions the first three Combine 
                                        positions have been captured by this loft.

                                        Karl von Gardony lays emphasis upon performance 
                                        as an important factor in the moulding 
                                        of his family based upon a strict selection 
                                        regime in fact he is always pursuing good 
                                        pigeons so much so that in 1987 or '88 
                                        about ten birds were purchased from Joop 
                                        Beumer of Holland and eight birds from 
                                        Raymund Hermes of Germany. This was added 
                                        to in 1992 with 16 Litherland Meulemans, 
                                        14 birds from Jan Grondelaers and 14 birds 
                                        from Maurits Voets Kesselwere. The latter 
                                        bloodlines today permeate his lofts and 
                                        since I started this series this is one 
                                        family in which I believe is an outcross 
                                        reality for according to sources von Gardony 
                                        sees a threat to the modern racing pigeon 
                                        from too close inbreeding or line breeding. 
                                        An interesting thesis which would imply 
                                        that there are really many roads to Rome 
                                        for this maestro has a list of many wins 
                                        to his credit. </p>

                                        outstanding example of his stock which 
                                        goes back to his original base is the 
                                        winner and only bird in the South Western 
                                        Ontario Combine race from Grand Mere flying 
                                        15 hours, 30 minutes and beating candidates 
                                        from 81 other lofts. This courageous hen 
                                        was of Sion X Barker bloodlines. Other 
                                        bloodlines that have worked well for Karl 
                                        are the Tourniers and Van Wanroys, Hector-Desmet-white 
                                        flight family, and the De Smet-Matthys.

                                      <p align="left">Karl 
                                        von Gardony would appear in matters of 
                                        health to be a hard task master for he 
                                        refuses to tolerate any weakness and any 
                                        pigeon showing signs of disease is eliminated 
                                        quickly. Early in the pigeons year the 
                                        usual precautions are taken relating to 
                                        the usual potential dangers but no medical 
                                        treatment is given during the racing season. 
                                        He flies to the nest and his family of 
                                        birds has won from all distances so much 
                                        so that he has been closed out of his 
                                        federation on occasions. Performances 
                                        of 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 
                                        9th and 10th with only 12 day birds at 
                                        450 miles illustrates why other fanciers 
                                        would be reluctant (although not justified) 
                                        to refuse to fly against von Gardony. 
                                        On another occasion he timed 8 pigeons 
                                        within two minutes in a 400 mile race.

                                      <p align="left">As 
                                        stated von Gardony's commitment to the 
                                        sport is second to none for aside from 
                                        his triumphs at racing he has served it 
                                        in various organizational positions including 
                                        a term as President of the Canadian Union. 
                                        Not bad for an immigrant from Hungary 
                                        who arrived in Canada in 1959 without 
                                        a word of English but who was determined 
                                        to adjust to the Canadian culture- the 
                                        same determination which has took him 
                                        to the top pinnacle of the sport in his 
                                        adopted country. A great Canadian pigeon 
                                        racer - (perhaps the greatest)! </p></td></tr></table>
